               <p>I grew up on the south side of Chicago. As a child I was always excited about learning how things worked. I could often be found with my head in a book or asking a million questions. Of all the things
	 I could explore I was drawn to technology and the internet. As a teen I 
	 created a digital yearbook for my classmates and I was the go-to girl for customizing MySpace pages. 
	 <br><br>
	 I am currently a student of the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion Program. 
	 Although I have no formal experience with Software Engineering, I am learning quickly and looking forward to excelling in the field. I look forward to being a part of a team of great programmers and collaborating on new and exciting projects.
	 <br><br>
	 I recognize that technology is a rapidly expanding field and as I have come to realize that I possess a natural talent and enjoy coding and designing. I have decided to embark upon this journey to learn all that I can and see just how far I can go. </p>
